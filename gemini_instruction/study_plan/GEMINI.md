* I am studying VLA models and want to gain insights into how they work, how well they work, and when do they stop working.
* From this mini-VLA project, I want to learn:
    * How the data collection is done.
    * How the inputs are encoded. 
    * The implementation of the diffusion model.
    * How the outputs are accquired. 
    * How the training is done and what are some training tricks applied here. 
    * How well mini-VLA performs in evaluation? When does it perform poorly?
    
* Afterwards, I would like to build upon this project:
    * Change encoding. 
    * Change model architecture. 
    * Change outputs. 
    * Trained on different data. 
    * Evaluation on harder tasks from other benchmarks. 
    * And other VLA tricks from the SOTA papers. 

* You would mainly:
    * Help me understand the codes and the theory behind it.
    * Point me to related papers so that I can gain deeper understanding of the techniques used here. 
    * Help me modify the existing codes to better suit my style of coding.
    * Add new functions to the codebase as we start to make our own improvements.
